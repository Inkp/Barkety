Barkety - An Akka compatible XMPP client library.
=================================================

While the [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org) project has an xmpp
component and though [Jive Software's
Smack](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) is ubiquitous neither
fulfil my desires:

  * Convenient roster management,
  * supervision heirarchy ready,
  * and actor-level isolation of state management.

Akka's bindings to camel-xmpp provide the last two and plain Smack allows only
the first point.
